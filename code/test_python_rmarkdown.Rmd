## A few silly Python tests in RMarkdown

### Very basic arrays

The code below creates an array called ``python "a"``, prints it and then prints the set version of the array.

```{python test_python_01}
a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
print(a)
print(set(a))
```

### Python modules

Modules are the python version of packages.

The code below imports the os module (typically used for operating system operations) and uses it to find out the current directory and print it.

```{python test_python_os}
import os

dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())
print(dir_path)
```
