```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## First: a few silly Python tests

The code below creates an array called ``python "a"``, prints it and then prints the set version of the array.

```{python test_python_01}
a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
print(a)
print(set(a))
```

Modules are the python version of packages.

The code below imports the os module (typically used for operating system operations) and uses it to find out the current directory and print it.

```{python test_python_os}
import os

dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())
print(dir_path)
```

## Now: test PyTorch installation

The code below loads PyTorch, prints its version and runs a small example.

```{python test_tf}
import torch
print(torch.version.git_version)
print(torch.version.debug)
print(torch.version.cuda)
x = torch.randn(3,5,6)
print(x)
```
